=== Building and Deploying

This is a Maven multi-module project. Build it from scratch using:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install
----

Build it without tests using:
[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

The default Maven goal is set to:
[source,shell]
----
clean install
----

This allows you to build the project just by running `mvn` at the root of the project.

If you want to generate and run the project site, execute:
[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install site site:stage site:run
----

The site will be available at link:http://localhost:9000[http://localhost:9000], but do not except all sections to be populated, only the `chapter09` subproject is documented.

This project does not necessarily require installing Apache Maven because it was configured to be run with an Apache Maven Wrapper. All previous commands can be  run with `./mvnw` instead of `mvn`.

*IMPORTANT:* The project was last built with the Java and Maven versions configured in the link:.sdkmanrc[.sdkmanrc] file.

==== Building using Docker

If you want to build the project using a Docker container, a Dockerfile is provided to you. Build the image using the following command (the 5th step is Maven build):
----
docker build -t java-23-bgn .
----
If you want to inspect the image contents, run the container image using:
----
docker run -it -p 9000:9000 --name java-23-bgn-build -v ${PWD}:/usr/src/java-23-for-absolute-beginners java-23-bgn
----

IMPORTANT: Or if you are using a Linux/Unix system, you can just execute the `build-and-serve.sh` provided with this project and the Docker image will be built, a container will be started and used to build the project and serve the docs at http://localhost:9000/. It might take a while, but it gets the job done.
